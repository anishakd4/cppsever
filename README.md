# This a minimal webserver using c++

I have setup using ngnix and C++ but you can can ditch ngnix. I will mention steps for both.

1. # Install boost library for async task and networking tasks

```
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev  # Ubuntu
brew install boost                 # macOS
```

2. # Clone this code or repo at system. Can be your laptop or a remote server like AWS instance.
